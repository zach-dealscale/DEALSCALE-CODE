Vague interest does not qualify.*\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n⏳ **Urgency Type** (select one — include a quote or clear reference):  \r\n- **Explicit Timeline** – “We need this in place by May 1”  \r\n- **Implied Timeline** – “Before the next hiring cycle”  \r\n- **Vague Timing** – “We’re interested in learning more”  \r\n- **No Timeline Mentioned**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n💬 **Top Signals (3–4 call quotes or rep-observed behaviors)**  \r\nUse only high-signal evidence that supports deal stage and urgency classification.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n📅 **Predicted Close Window (in weeks)**  \r\nBreak the projected close path into buyer steps with time estimates.

Base your confidence on **actions**, not tone. Add a brief justification:\r\n> “Confidence: Low — buyer is engaged but hasn’t committed to action, no timeline or budget.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNow read the following transcript and extract only what is **directly supported by the conversation**.
