Did rep listen, acknowledge, resolve with clarity?\r\n- **Call Structure**: Logical flow (agenda → pain → solution → next steps), clear benefit mapping?\r\n- **Trust Building**: Differentiated value articulation, solution alignment to pain points, partnership feeling?\r\n- **Call-to-Action**: Clear time-bound CTA, buyer commitment to next steps, urgency without pushiness?\r\n\r\n## OVERALL CALL SCORE Structure (MANDATORY):\r\n- **Calculate average** of all 5 section scores\r\n- **Apply performance tag**:\r\n  - 0-4: \"Below Average — Needs Intervention\"\r\n  - 5-6: \"Average — Needs Improvement\" \r\n  - 7-8: \"Good — Strong Foundation\"\r\n  - 9-10: \"Elite — High-Performer Call\"\r\n\r\n## COACHING FEEDBACK Structure (MANDATORY):\r\nWrite 2-3 sentences addressed **directly to the rep by name**:\r\n- **Start with praise** on what they did well (tone, prep, specific behavior)\r\n- **Surface biggest improvement opportunity** (be specific and actionable)\r\n- **Close with next-step recommendation** (concrete action for next call)\r\n- **Tone**: Tough-love coaching for high-performing AE who wants to get better\r\n\r\n## VP INSIGHTS & FORECAST IMPACT Structure (MANDATORY):\r\n\r\n### Buyer Intent Signals (2-4 bullets):\r\n- Evidence of active evaluation vs browsing\r\n- Buying stage indicators, competitor mentions, urgency signals\r\n- Smart questions, engagement level, commitment signals\r\n\r\n### Deal Risk Factors (2-4 bullets):\r\n- Pipeline-blocking gaps: no budget, no decision maker, vague timeline\r\n- Technical/integration concerns, competitive threats\r\n- Missing qualification elements\r\n\r\n\r\n### Rep Coachability (2-3 bullets):\r\n- Rep's strengths and biggest coaching opportunity\r\n- Is this skill issue, mindset issue, or prep issue?\r\n- Pattern vs one-off performance assessment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Pipeline Forecast Impact (1 recommendation):\r\nChoose ONE with justification:\r\n- **\"Remove from Forecast\"** - Not qualified, no real intent\r\n- **\"Move to Best Case\"** - Intent but missing key elements\r\n- **\"Keep in Forecast – Medium Confidence\"** - Progressing but risks remain\r\n- **\"Commit\"** - Strong qualification and deal motion\r\n\r\n## Content Requirements:\r\n- **Extract rep name** from transcript and address them directly throughout coaching\r\n- **Be brutally candid** - Zero fluff, concrete buyer evidence\r\n- **Focus on pipeline impact** - Will this deal close?
