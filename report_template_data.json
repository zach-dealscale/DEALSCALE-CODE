E.g., \"Moderate confidence. Champion and DM engaged, but buying process and legal progress unclear.\"]\n________________________________________\nLLM GUIDELINES — INTERNAL ONLY (DO NOT SHOW IN OUTPUT)\n________________________________________\nIn all cases, the term “Win Probability” represents the final adjusted score \nafter applying all weights, stage modifiers, behavioral multipliers, and confidence normalization.\nDo not output “Final Adjusted Score.” Use “Win Probability” as the single forecast metric.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- Always perform full internal calculations (raw score, stage modifiers, behavioral multipliers, normalization),\n  but DO NOT display or mention any intermediate values such as:\n  • Raw Score\n  • Stage Modifiers\n  • Behavioral Multipliers\n  • Confidence Normalization\n  • Adjustment Ranges\n- Only display the final metric as:\n  \"Win Probability: [ ] %\"\n  followed by its one-line justification.\n- Keep intermediate math hidden within your reasoning or metadata layer.\n- The user-facing report must look clean and executive-ready.\nStage-Based Modifiers Applied\nStage\tModifiers\nDiscovery\tChampion Momentum × 1.5, Problem Urgency × 1.5, Decision Maker × 0.5\nEvaluation\tAll factors at base weight\nValidation\tDecision Maker × 1.5, Buying Process × 1.5, Technical Fit × 1.2\nProcurement\tEconomic Buyer × 1.5, Budget Authority × 1.3, Timeline Specificity × 1.2\n________________________________________\nBehavioral Multipliers Applied\nPositive Multipliers (Apply cumulatively, max 1.8×)\n• × 1.2 = Buyer references specific business metrics (revenue, costs, efficiency)\n• × 1.3 = Mutual action plan created with dates and owners\n• × 1.4 = Executive sponsorship established and engaged\n• × 1.2 = Unique access granted beyond standard process\nNegative Multipliers (Apply cumulatively, min 0.4×)\n• × 0.8 = 14+ days without engagement or delayed responses\n• × 0.7 = Vague timeline language without specific dates\n• × 0.6 = Key decision maker consistently missing from calls\n• × 0.8 = Competitive bake-off or formal RFP process\n\n________________________________________\nAdd the adaptive bias correction \nAfter behavioral multipliers, check whether the deal shows unusually strong buying intent:\n•\tChampion Momentum ≥ 2 (proactive or evangelist)\n•\tEconomic Buyer ≥ 1 (identified or engaged)\n•\tProblem Urgency ≥ 2 (clear pain with impact)\n• If all three are present in Discovery or Evaluation, modestly increase the confidence (about +20 percent of the stage’s available range).\n• If all three are present in Validation or Procurement, apply a smaller boost (about +10 percent of the stage’s range).\n• If these conditions are not met, no bias boost is applied.\nThis small upward adjustment rewards the proven pattern that most closed-won deals share without allowing scores to exceed stage ceilings.\n\n________________________________________\nConfidence Normalization (Stage-Based Floor & Ceiling)\nStage\tMin % (Floor)\tMax % (Ceiling)\nDiscovery\t10 %\t35 %\nEvaluation\t25 %\t60 %\nValidation\t50 %\t85 %\nProcurement\t75 %\t95 %\nFinal score = (Adjusted Raw × Multipliers) normalized within stage band.\nPrevents over-swinging forecasts and ensures board-level credibility.\n________________________________________\nTIERED SCORING FRAMEWORK (0–3 Scale)\nApply consistently across all factors:\nCHAMPION MOMENTUM (0.20)\n• 0 = Passive / ghosting (minimal participation, delayed responses)\n• 1 = Reactive participant (answers questions, doesn't drive)\n• 2 = Proactively scheduling (coordinates meetings, adds colleagues)\n• 3 = Internal evangelist (sharing docs, building internal consensus)\nDECISION MAKER ENGAGEMENT (0.15)\n• 0 = No DM identified\n• 1 = DM named but not engaged\n• 2 = DM participating in calls\n• 3 = DM driving timeline/process and asking budget questions\nECONOMIC BUYER ENGAGEMENT (0.10)\n• 0 = Missing from process\n• 1 = Aware of initiative\n• 2 = Discussed ROI / cost benefit\n• 3 = Confirmed spend authority and timeline\nPROBLEM URGENCY (0.15)\n• 0 = “Just exploring” no clear pain\n• 1 = General interest, minor inconvenience\n• 2 = Clear pain affecting business metrics\n• 3 = Must-solve-now with financial impact stated\nBUYING PROCESS CLARITY (0.12)\n• 0 = “We're just looking” no process\n• 1 = General interest, no defined steps\n• 2 = Defined evaluation steps and timeline\n• 3 = Mutual action plan with specific dates and owners\nSTAKEHOLDER COVERAGE (0.10)\n• 0 = Single point of contact only\n• 1 = Multiple team members involved\n• 2 = Cross-functional team engaged\n• 3 = Full buying committee including executives\nBUDGET AUTHORITY (0.10)\n• 0 = No budget discussion\n• 1 = Implied budget (company size suggests capacity)\n• 2 = Budget range discussed or “approved for initiative”\n• 3 = Specific budget confirmed and timeline for spend\nTIMELINE SPECIFICITY (0.08)\n• 0 = No timeline mentioned\n• 1 = Vague references (“soon”, “next quarter”)\n• 2 = Specific quarter or month mentioned\n• 3 = Exact dates or “decision by [date]” stated\nCOMPETITIVE POSITION (0.05)\n• 0 = Actively evaluating competitors\n• 1 = Competitors mentioned but no details\n• 2 = No competitors mentioned, focused on solution\n• 3 = Given unique access/demos beyond competitors\nTECHNICAL FIT (0.05)\n• 0 = Major integration barriers\n• 1 = General fit, some questions remain\n• 2 = Good fit, minor customization needed\n• 3 = Perfect fit, ready to implement\nSTAGE DETERMINATION GUIDELINES\n• Discovery = Initial calls, problem exploration, no defined process\n• Evaluation = Product demos, multiple stakeholders, comparing options\n• Validation = Technical deep dives, security reviews, reference calls\n• Procurement = Contract negotiation, legal review, final approval\n________________________________________\nBEHAVIORAL MULTIPLIER TRIGGERS\nApply these after raw score calculation to reflect real buyer behavior.\nPOSITIVE MULTIPLIERS (Apply cumulatively, max 1.8×)\n• × 1.2 = Buyer explicitly references business metrics (revenue, costs, efficiency)\n• × 1.3 = Mutual Action Plan (MAP) created with dates and owners\n• × 1.4 = Executive sponsorship active in calls or approvals\n• × 1.2 = Unique vendor access / early position in evaluation\nNEGATIVE MULTIPLIERS (Apply cumulatively, min 0.4×)\n• × 0.8 = 14+ days since last engagement (engagement decay)\n• × 0.7 = Timeline remains vague / shifting without specific dates\n• × 0.6 = Key Decision Maker or Economic Buyer absent from process\n• × 0.8 = Active competitive bake-off or formal RFP detected\n________________________________________\nCONFIDENCE BENCHMARKS BY STAGE\nThese define defensible ranges for final Win Probability after normalization.\nThey anchor forecasts to real-world sales friction patterns and executive expectations.\n• Discovery (10–35 %) → Early qualification, light commitment, low urgency.\n• Evaluation (25–60 %) → Engaged buyers, demo completed, stakeholders aligned.\n• Validation (50–85 %) → Technical fit confirmed, procurement in motion.\n• Procurement (75–95 %) → Final legal / budget steps before signature.\n________________________________________\nQUALITATIVE OVERRIDE FLAGS\nTrigger manual review when:\n• Score > 70 % but no DM engagement → Investigate immediately.\n• Score < 30 % but Champion is C-level → Possible hidden process.\n• Timeline > 90 days but urgency claimed → Contradiction.\n• Raw score > 80 % with negatives applied → Over-optimistic.\n________________________________________\nEXECUTIVE SCORING NOTES GUIDELINES\n• Be specific: “DM asked budget questions” not “DM engaged.”\n• Cite evidence: “Stated ‘need to solve Q3’ with specific metrics.”\n• Note absences: “No IT stakeholders present in technical discussion.”\n• Keep executive-focused: ≤ 15 words, business impact oriented.\n________________________________________\nCalculation Process\n1.\tScore each factor 0–3 based on transcript evidence.\n2.\tWeighted contribution = (Score ÷ 3) × Weight.\n3.\tSum weighted contributions = Raw Score %.\n4.\tApply stage-based modifiers.\n5.\tApply behavioral multipliers.\n6.\tNormalize within stage confidence range.\n7.\tRound to nearest 5 % for final Win

Anti-hallucination\n\nNever invent hooks, quotes, or objections.\n\nIf missing → TBD (not in transcripts) — [specific probe/action].\n\nQuotes must be ≤12 words, anchored in transcript language.\n\n3. Section Header Enforcement\n\nAlways output section headers as written in the template.\n\nNever omit or merge (e.g., “Executive Summary,” “Top Messaging Angles,” etc.).\nCall Analysis Instructions:\nThis template is designed to analyze dozens or hundreds of call transcripts (discovery, demo, or late-stage). The goal is to identify the strongest cold outreach angles based on what real buyers say — especially frustrations, objections, and language that signals high intent or resistance.\nUse the prompts embedded below to guide the system. Be precise. It’s not about summarizing each call — it’s about pattern detection across many.\nExecutive Summary Prompt:\nFrom all the calls, extract the most commonly effective cold messaging hook, the most frequently cited pain point, words that triggered negative reactions, and any late-stage insights that can be tested as cold openers.\n\nTop Messaging Angles Prompt:\nFor each of the top hooks detected, match it to the buyer pain it solves, a real quote that proves it came from a transcript, and a high-performing cold subject line suggestion.\n\nPersona-Language Map Prompt:\nMap top pain phrases by persona. Then generate cold email lines that mirror those pains and signal value fast.\n\nMessaging Heatmap Prompt:\nEvaluate what words or themes triggered positive emotional response or interest, and which triggered skepticism or disengagement. Score each as High / Medium / Low and suggest an action.\n\nCopy Block Generator Prompt:\nTurn the highest-performing angles into ready-to-use cold email opening lines that can be pasted into Salesloft or Outreach.\n\nTactical Recommendations Prompt:\nRecommend 3 tactical actions based on the patterns found — e.g., email tests, sequence updates, enablement content.\n\nThe following sections must always be formatted as tables with clear headers and rows (no bullet points, no narrative text):\n\nTop Messaging Angles (From Real Buyer Quotes)\n\nPersona-Language Map (Copy By Role)\n\nMessaging Heatmap (What to Push / What to Drop)\n\nCopy Block Generator",
